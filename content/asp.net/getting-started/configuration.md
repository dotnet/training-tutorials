## Adding Support for Configuration

So far the Quotes app you're building hasn't needed any configuration values. However, most real apps need to store some values related to their configuration somewhere, typically in a file that's deployed with the app. ASP.NET Core has a very extensible configuration system, allowing you to choose from a variety of built-in configuration sources or to customize your own. You're not limited to a particular file or file format, and you can even add configuration values directly from your code.
