# Manipulating Entities 
 
Four operations that we often perform on a record in a database are Create, Read, Update, and Delete (commonly referred to as "CRUD" operations). We walked through how to read records from a database in the [Querying Data](querying.md) lesson. In this lesson, we'll learn how to perform the other CRUD operations which allow us to manipulate records in the database.

## Adding Entities to a Database 
 
Let's first look at how to create a new record in the database. In the following example, we create a new `Author` and add it to the database: 
  
```{.snippet}
using (var context = new LibraryContext()) 
{ 
    var author = new Author 
    {  
        FirstName = "Mary",  
        LastName = "Shelley", 
        Books = new List<Book>() 
    }; 
    context.Authors.Add(author); 
    context.SaveChanges(); 
} 
``` 
:::repl{data-name=adding-entities} 
::: 
 
As you can see, it is easy to add new entities to the database with EF Core. First, we add the entity to the database using the `Add` method of the `DbSet`, much like we would when adding items to a `List`. Next, we call the context's `SaveChanges` method. This step is essential because rather than write changes to the database right away, EF Core keeps track of all the pending changes and waits to write them until `SaveChanges` is called. 
 
Notice that we do not specify the `Id` property before adding the author to the database. This is because `Id` is a generated property, meaning EF Core will automatically generate a value for it. 
 
## Adding Related Data 
 
In the previous example, we added an author without any books to the database. Now we want to add an author and their books to the database. To add related entities like this to the database using EF Core we simply call the `Add` method on the parent entity. It will then automatically add the parentâ€™s related entities to the database. In the following example, we add a new author and their books to the database by simply adding the author:
 
```{.snippet}
using (var context = new LibraryContext()) 
{ 
    var author = new Author 
    {  
        FirstName = "Mary",  
        LastName = "Shelley", 
        Books = new List<Book> { 
            new Book 
            { 
                Title = "Frankenstein: or, The Modern Prometheus", 
                Genre = "Science Fiction", 
                PublicationYear = 1818 
            } 
        } 
    }; 
    context.Authors.Add(author); 
    context.SaveChanges(); 
} 
``` 
:::repl{data-name=adding-related-entities} 
::: 
 
If we want to add a new entity that is related to an existing entity, we first load the existing entity, then add the related entity to it. For example, to add a new book to an existing author we would load the author and then add the book to the author's list of books. Calling `SaveChanges` would then add the new book to the database. 
 
```{.snippet}
using (var context = new LibraryContext()) 
{ 
    var author = context.Authors
        .Include(a => a.Books) 
        .Single(a => a.LastName == "Crane");
 
    var book = new Book 
    { 
        Title = "The Red Badge of Courage", 
        Genre = "War Novel", 
        PublicationYear = 1871 
    };
 
    author.Books.Add(book); 
    context.SaveChanges(); 
} 
``` 
:::repl{data-name=add-new-entity-to-existing}

## Updating Entities in a Database 
 
Next, let's look at how to update records that are already in the database. For example, we might discover that one of our books was catalogued incorrectly. _Mrs Dalloway_ should be _To the Lighthouse_. To fix this, we update the title and publication year of the book:
 
```{.snippet} 
using (var context = new LibraryContext()) 
{ 
    var book = context.Books
        .Single(b => b.Title == "Mrs Dalloway"); 
    book.Title = "To the Lighthouse";
    book.PublicationYear = 1927;
    context.SaveChanges(); 
} 
``` 
:::repl{data-name=updating-entities} 
::: 

Notice we did not have to tell EF Core that the entity had been changed to update its values. This is because the book we retrieved from the database is a **tracked entity**, meaning EF Core will keep track of any changes made to it. EF Core will continue to track changes made to the entity until the context is disposed, which occurs automatically when leaving the `using` block. To learn more about tracked entities, check out the [Tracking vs. No-Tracking](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/querying/tracking) page in the docs. 
 
Suppose you want to update an untracked entity. As long as the untracked entity has the same primary key as the record in the database, you can accomplish this using the `DbSet`'s `Update` method. In the following example, we update the title, genre, and publication year of the book with an `Id` of 1 without tracking the entity: 
 
```{.snippet} 
using (var context = new LibraryContext()) 
{ 
    var untrackedBook = new Book() 
    { 
        Id = 1, 
        Title = "To the Lighthouse",
        Genre = "Literary",
        PublicationYear = 1927 
    };
	
    context.Books.Update(untrackedBook); 
    context.SaveChanges(); 
} 
``` 
:::repl{data-name=updating-untracked-entities} 
::: 
 
## Deleting Entities 
 
Finally, let's look at how to delete records from the database. This can be accomplished using the `DbSet`'s `Remove` method. The following example demonstrates removing a book from the database:  
 
```{.snippet}  
using (var context = new LibraryContext()) 
{ 
    var book = context.Books.First(); 
    context.Books.Remove(book); 
    context.SaveChanges(); 
} 
```

## Deleting Related Data 
 
In the previous example, we were able to successfully delete a book, but what happened to that book's checkout records? The short answer is it depends. The way that EF Core handles deletion of an entity with related data depends on several factors including whether the related data is tracked, how EF Core is configured, and how the database is configured. By default, EF Core will delete any tracked dependents of the principal entity when it is deleted. This is known as **cascade deletion** because the deletion is cascaded down to the dependents. There are other deletion behaviors, but they are too advanced for this tutorial. For more information on these behaviors, see the ["Cascade Delete"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/saving/cascade-delete) page in the docs.
