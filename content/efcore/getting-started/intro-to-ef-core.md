# Intro to EF Core

Entity Framework Core (EF Core) is a lightweight, extensible, and cross-platform version of Entity Framework. Entity Framework is an object-relational mapper (O/RM) that enables .NET developers to work with a database using .NET objects. This allows developers to create and manage databases without most of the data-access code that developers usually need to write.Â 

EF Core and the latest version of Entity Framework (EF6.x) differ in the features they support. A comparison of the features supported by each can be found on the [feature comparison page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/efcore-and-ef6/features) of the docs. If you want help determining which version is best for your project, check out the ["Which One Is Right for You?"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/efcore-and-ef6/choosing) page.

## Database Providers 
 
At the moment, EF Core only supports relational databases, but there are plans to add support for non-relational databases in the future. Supported database providers are listed on the [Database Providers page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/providers/) in the docs.
