# Implementing Logical Expressions
by [Steve Smith](http://deviq.com/me/steve-smith)

## Logical Operators

Logical *expressions* are composed of *operators* and *operands*. You can define your own operators in C#, but that's a more advanced topic. C# provides many built-in operators that you can use to create logical expressions, which are useful when implementing conditional statements, as you saw in the [previous lesson](making-decisions). Logical expressions evaluate to ``true`` or ``false``, and as such they are often called ``boolean`` expressions, since they are evaluated as ``bool`` types (and can be assigned to boolean variables).

### Comparison Operators

You've already seen several comparison operators. Below are many of the built-in operators:

```c#
==  // equal
!=  // not equal
>   // greater than
<   // less than
>=  // greater than or equal
<=  // less than or equal
```

> **Tip** {.tip .javascript}    
> Unlike in JavaScript, C# uses strict comparison rules, so its equality comparisons will work like `===` and `!==` by default.

Each of the comparison operators requires two operands, one on each side of the expression. For example:

```{.snippet}
x < 10
y >= 0
```
```{.REPL}
using System;

namespace ConsoleApplication
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            int x = 15;
            int y = 10;
            Console.WriteLine(x < 10);
            Console.WriteLine(y >= 0);
        }
    }
}
```

To test if a value is between two numbers, you need to check the two conditions separately. The following is not a legal C# expression:

```c#
1 <= x <= 10 // x between 1 and 10 inclusive - DOES NOT COMPILE
```

To combine multiple expression, you use logical operators.

### Conditional Logical Operators

Conditional logical operators are used to combine multiple logical expressions. The most common logical operators are *and*, *or*, and *not*, which are represented as follows:

```c#
&&  // logical AND
||  // logical OR
!   // logical NOT (often read as 'bang')
^   // logical XOR (exclusive OR)
```

The ``&&``, ``||``, and ``^`` operators require two operands; the ``!`` operator takes only one, and is applied as a prefix. For example:

```{.snippet}
true && true    // true
true && false   // false
false && false  // false

true || true    // true
true || false   // true
false || false  // false

true ^ true     // false
true ^ false    // true
false ^ false   // false

!true           // false
!false          // true
```
```{.REPL}
using System;

namespace ConsoleApplication
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            Console.WriteLine(true && true);    // true
            Console.WriteLine(true && false);   // false
            Console.WriteLine(false && false);  // false

            Console.WriteLine(true || true);    // true
            Console.WriteLine(true || false);   // true
            Console.WriteLine(false || false);  // false

            Console.WriteLine(true ^ true);     // false
            Console.WriteLine(true ^ false);    // true
            Console.WriteLine(false ^ false);   // false

            Console.WriteLine(!true);           // false
            Console.WriteLine(!false);          // true
        }
    }
}
```

> **Note** {.note}    
> C# also includes *bitwise* logical operators, ``&`` (AND), ``|`` (OR). These are used to perform binary comparisons of numeric values, and generally aren't used directly for conditional expressions. The ``^`` (XOR) operator can be used with both boolean and integral operands.

Logical operations are applied left to right, and will *short-circuit*. That is, if the left operand of an ``&&`` operator is false, the right operand will not be evaluated. This is often important, since the operands themselves may be method calls, not variables. You'll learn more about methods in [lesson 12](methods).

Logical expressions are grouped using parentheses, which modify their order of operations just as in algebra. For example:

```{.snippet}
int a = 5;
int b = 10;
if((a < b) && (b < 20))
{
    // do something
}
```
```{.REPL}
using System;

namespace ConsoleApplication
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            int a = 5;
            int b = 10;
            if((a < b) && (b < 20))
            {
                Console.WriteLine("I'm in here!");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

> **Tip** {.tip .newLanguage}    
> Be careful with parentheses in logical expressions - it's easy to forget to close one. It can be a good practice, especially when you're getting started, to type all of the pairs of parentheses first, and then fill in the values and expressions.

### Flags

A boolean (``bool``) variable is often referred to as a *flag*. Flags can be useful as a means giving a name to a particular condition. For example:

```{.snippet}
int x = 10;
bool isPositive = x > 0;
if(isPositive)
{
    // do something
}
```
```{.REPL}
using System;

namespace ConsoleApplication
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            int x = 10;
            bool isPositive = x > 0;
            if(isPositive)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("I'm in here!");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Often, programs will include complex conditional logic, and it can be helpful to simplify some or all of this complexity into named variables. Flags can be attached to objects as *properties*, such that you can test for their value as part of the object itself (example: ``if(x.IsPositive)``. However, when writing *object-oriented* programs, it's often better to [avoid using flags](http://deviq.com/flags-over-objects/), since they can lead to program designs that are more procedural and don't encapsulate behavior effectively within objects. You'll learn more about object design in the [Encapsulation and Object-Oriented Design](encapsulation-oop) lesson.

> **Tip** {.tip .newLanguage}    
> It's a typical convention to name boolean variables with an "Is" or "is" prefix, since this makes it clear the variable is a boolean and also makes reading conditional statements more clear as well. Avoid naming flags negatively (example: "IsNotPositive"), since this can become confusing, especially when the flag is negated with the ``!`` operator.

## Next Steps

Write a program that greets the user using the appropriate greeting for the time of day. Use only ``if``, not ``else`` or ``switch``, statements to do so. Be sure to include the following greetings:

- "Good Morning"
- "Good Afternoon"
- "Good Evening"
- "Good Night"

It's up to you which times should serve as the starting and ending ranges for each of the greetings. If you need a refresher on how to get the current time, see [Working with Dates and Times](datetimes) lesson. When testing your program, you'll probably want to use a ``DateTime`` variable you define, rather than the current time. Once you're confident the program works correctly, you can substitute ``DateTime.Now`` for your variable (or keep your variable and just assign ``DateTime.Now`` as its value, which is often a better approach).
