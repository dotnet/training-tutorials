## Common C# Patterns and Anti-Patterns

Common approaches to solving similar problems are referred to as *design patterns*. Common approaches to solving similar problems that often end up causing more problems than they solve are called *anti-patterns* (or *antipatterns*). As you continue learning C#, there are a few of each to keep in mind.

**Note:** Learn more about [design patterns](http://deviq.com/design-patterns/) and [antipatterns](http://deviq.com/antipatterns/).

In this lesson, you're going to learn about *adapter*, *factory*, *repository*, and *strategy* design patterns. You'll also learn about two related antipatterns: *Singleton* and *Static Cling*, which also relate [new is glue](http://ardalis.com/new-is-glue), which you learned about in a previous lesson.
